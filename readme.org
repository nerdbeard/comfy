* Intro
I want to put together a complete 6502 environment in elisp.

Features:
- simulate multiple processors concurrently
- simulate arbitrary hardware environments
- assemble source code into ROMs and other images
- emulate 6502 to run and debug code

Simulation goals:
- Two 6502s communicating via a serial interface
- A group of 6502s communicating via packet radio
* References
- https://github.com/gongo/emacs-nes includes a 6502 emulator!

This is my version of COMFY-65 ported to modern elisp and without the namespace pollution.  I used this to clean it up from the original:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun comfify (sym)
    (interactive "SSymbol: ")
    (replace-regexp (format "\\b%s\\b" sym)
		    (format "comfy-%s" sym)))a
#+END_SRC
It still uses a bunch of globals for state and should be given a proper data structure if it is going to be used.  It's questionable how useful it actually is and may merely serve as a model for my own version.  Also, what is the license?
